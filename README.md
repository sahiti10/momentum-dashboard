## üìñ Description

Momentum is a professional-grade, real-time analytics dashboard built to track and analyze marketing campaign performance. It features a dynamic, polished UI that simulates a live data feed, providing stakeholders with up-to-the-second insights.

This project was built from the ground up to demonstrate a strong command of modern front-end development practices, including React Hooks, component-based architecture, asynchronous data handling, and professional deployment workflows (CI/CD).

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-Time Data Simulation:** The dashboard updates every few seconds to mimic a live data stream, showcasing dynamic state management.
* **Interactive Charts:** Utilizes Chart.js for clean, responsive, and animated data visualizations.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with reusable and modular components for scalability and maintainability (e.g., `KpiCard`, `LineChart`).
* **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless and optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Professional CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrated with Vercel for continuous deployment, automatically deploying new versions on every `git push` to the main branch.

---

## üíª Technologies Used

* **Front-End:** React, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
* **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
* **Data & API:** Asynchronous Fetch, REST API Simulation
* **Charting:** Chart.js with `react-chartjs-2`
* **Deployment & DevOps:** Vercel, Git, GitHub, Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
* **Development Tools:** npm, Visual Studio Code

## üë§ My Role & Contributions

As the sole developer for this portfolio project, I was responsible for the complete lifecycle of the application:

* **Architecture:** Designed the component structure and data flow from the ground up.
* **UI/UX Development:** Translated a product concept into a fully functional and visually polished user interface using React and modern CSS.
* **State & Data Logic:** Implemented the "real-time" data simulation using `setInterval` and asynchronous functions to manage and update the application state dynamically.
* **Deployment:** Set up the entire continuous deployment pipeline by linking the GitHub repository to Vercel, enabling automated builds and deployments.

## üöÄ Live Deployment & CI/CD

This project is hosted on **Vercel** and configured for Continuous Deployment.

1.  A `git push` to the `main` branch on GitHub automatically triggers a new build process on Vercel.
2.  Vercel installs dependencies, runs a production build of the React app, and deploys it to its global CDN.
3.  The live URL is instantly updated with the new version, demonstrating a modern, automated development workflow.
